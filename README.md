# Hello0MQ

This is a SBT project composed of a couple of subprojects (namely, server and client) which provides a basic Request/Reply ZeroMQ pattern written in Scala based on the examples that can be found [here](https://github.com/imatix/zguide/tree/master/examples/Scala)

## How to run it in OS X (El Capitan)
Before you can run this project locally, `libzmq` library must be built and installed locally and a Java binding ([JZMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq)) must also be build and installed. Details about how to do that in OS X (El Capitan) can be found in my blog [post](http://oscar-martin.github.io/articles/0mq-with-scala-in-os-x-el-capitan.html)
